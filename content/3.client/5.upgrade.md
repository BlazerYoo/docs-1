# Upgrade guide

## From `3.X` to `4.X`

You will need the latest version of the proxy worker. Redeploy a new worker using [our self-hosting guide](../2.proxy/1.deploy.md).

After you have the new worker, you will need to [get the new movie-web deployment files](https://github.com/movie-web/movie-web/releases/latest). **You CANNOT use the non-PWA version**. To upgrade safely without any complications, you need to update with `movie-web.pwa.zip`, Not the non-PWA version.

In the future, you will **ALWAYS** need to go with the PWA option. You cannot downgrade to non-PWA version without facing many caching complications.
