# Streaming

This page explains all the different ways you can enable movie-web to stream your favorite movies & TV shows, each with their own pros and cons.

<!-- ## Method 1 - Browser extension

The movie-web browser extension is the easiest way to be able to watch media with fast streaming speeds, it is available for both [Chrome] and [Firefox].

This method is great if you only use movie-web on your computer. If you use a mobile device or smart TV, you'll unfortunately have to stick to using a proxy since these devices don't usually support browser extensions.

Since this method uses your own IP, it is undetectable by streaming services, so you can use it to watch your favorite shows without worrying about getting blocked by their servers. -->

## Method 1 - Self-hosted proxy

Self-hosting a proxy is an easy way to get good streaming speeds, [we have a guide](../2.proxy/1.deploy.md) that explains how to set up one for **free**.

This method is recommended if you want to host a proxy for your friends and or family to use, as it is the fastest and most reliable way to stream media at the moment.

<!-- This method is recommended if you want to host a proxy for your friends and family to use, or if you want to use movie-web on a device that doesn't support the [browser extension](#method-1---browser-extension), such as a smart TV or mobile device. -->

## Method 2 - Public proxy

The public proxy is the easiest way to get started with movie-web, it is hosted by us and is completely free to use.

It is also the default option when you start using movie-web.app at first, but it is recommended that you [host your own proxy](#method-1---self-hosted-proxy).

<!-- It is also the default option when you start using movie-web.app at first, but it is recommended that you either [host your own proxy](#method-2---self-hosted-proxy) or use our [browser extension](#method-1---browser-extension). -->
