# Introduction to the proxy
Our proxy is used to bypass CORS-protected URLs on the client side, allowing users to make requests to CORS protected endpoints without a backend server.

The proxy is made using [Nitro by UnJS](https://nitro.unjs.io/) which supports building the proxy to work on multiple providers including Cloudflare Workers, AWS Lambda and [more...](https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy)

Our recommended provider is Cloudflare due to its [generous free plan](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/plans/developer-platform/).
