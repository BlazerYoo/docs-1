# Deploying the proxy

## Method 1 - Cloudflare (Easy)

Cloudflare has a generous free plan, so you don't need to pay anything unless you get hundreds of users.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/movie-web/simple-proxy)

1. Create a GitHub account at https://github.com if you don't have one.
1. Click the `Deploy with workers` button above.
1. Click the `Authorize Workers` button to authorise Cloudflare to talk to GitHub.
1. Authorize Cloudflare Workers in the GitHub page that pops up.
1. Follow the instructions to configure your Cloudflare account. Select `I have an account` if you have a Cloudflare account already, otherwise follow the link to create one.
1. Click the link to `Workers Dashboard` to find your account ID.
    1. You can copy your account ID from the URL e.g. https://dash.cloudflare.com/ab7cb454c93987b6343350d4e84c16c7/workers-and-pages/create where `ab7cb454c93987b6343350d4e84c16c7` is the account ID.
    1. Paste the account ID into the text box on the original Cloudflare workers page.
1. Click the link to `My Profile` to create an API token. 
    1. Click `Create Token`.
    1. Select `Use template` next to `Edit Cloudflare Workers`.
    1. Under `Account Resources`, select `Include` and your account under the dropdown.
    1. Under `Zone Resources`, select `All zones` (You can select a more specific zone if you have the zones available).
    1. At the bottom of the page, click `Continue to summary`.
    1. On the next screen, click `Create token`.
    1. Copy the API token and **save it in a safe place, it won't be shown again**.
    1. Paste the API token into the Cloudflare Workers API Token text box.
1. Click `Fork the Repository` and follow the instructions to enable workflows.
1. Click `Deploy` to deploy to Cloudflare Workers.
1. Congratulations! Your worker is now deploying. Please wait for the GitHub Action to build and publish your worker. 
1. You can click the `Worker dash` and `GitHub repo` buttons to see the status of the deploy.
1. When the worker has deployed, you will need to take note of the URL. This can be found on Cloudflare under Workers and Pages -> Overview -> Proxy.

## Method 1 - Cloudflare (Manual)
1. Login to your Cloudflare account if you have one, otherwise create one [here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)
    1. If you are signing up for an account, make sure to verify your email before going further!
1. Download the latest version of the Cloudflare [`simple-proxy-cloudflare.mjs` script from here](https://github.com/movie-web/simple-proxy/releases/latest/download/simple-proxy-cloudflare.mjs).
1. Go to `Workers & Pages` and then `Overview` in the left-hand navigation bar.
1. Click the `Create Worker` button
    1. If you've made a worker or pages application before, you will need to click `Create Application` first
1. Give your worker a name and click `Deploy`. This can be anything you would like!
1. On the `Congratulations` web page, click the `Edit code` button to edit the code in the worker you have just created.
1. There should now be a code editor on the left hand side on the web page.
    1. Select all of the existing template code and delete it. **You must make sure all of the code is deleted for this to work!**
    1. Go to your downloads folder and open up the `simple-proxy-cloudflare.mjs` file you downloaded earlier in a text editor, and **copy** the contents.
    1. Back in your browser, paste the contents of the file into the code editor.
1. The `Save and deploy` button in the top right corner should now be active, click it to deploy your proxy!
1. A confirmation dialog will appear, click `Save and deploy` once more.
1. Your worker is now deployed! You can click the back button in the top left to take you back to the summary screen.
1. On the summary screen, your worker link will be displayed under `Preview`. Right click the link, click `Copy link address` and save the link somewhere - you will need it to setup the client! 

## Method 2 - Docker

::alert{type="warning"}
Experience with Docker, domains and web hosting is **highly recommended** for this method. <br />
[Deploying with Cloudflare](#method-1-cloudflare-easy) is easier and safer to do! You are exposing your server at your own risk!
::

Our `simple-proxy` application is available from the GitHub Container Registry under the image `ghcr.io/movie-web/simple-proxy:latest` :copy-button{content="ghcr.io/movie-web/simple-proxy:latest"}

The container exposes the HTTP port (Without TLS/SSL) as `3000/TCP`.

If you know what you are doing, you should know what to do with this information. If you don't, then please follow our Cloudflare guides.
