# Troubleshooting

There is always a possibility for something to go wrong while trying to deploy your own instance of movie-web. This page will contain common issues people come across while self-hosting and their solutions.

## "Failed to find media, try again!" while searching

This is likely a misconfigured TMDB api key. Verify that TMDB isn't working by going to `/admin` or `/#/admin`. Then clicking `Test TMDB`.

If it succeeds, the TMDB api key is correct and it will be a different issue.

If it does not work. Recheck your TMDB api key. **Make sure its the READ api key, not the normal api key.**

## Everything I try to watch fails

This is likely a misconfigured worker. Verify that the workers are the issue by going to `/admin` or `/#/admin`. Then clicking `Test workers`.

You should have at least 1 worker registered.

If any worker fails the test, you should double check its URL and double check if the worker has the correct code.

## I can't make an account or login

This is likely misconfigured or broken backend. Verify the backend by going to `/admin` or `/#/admin`. Then clicking `Test backend`.

It should give you the name that you have configured as backend with the latest version of the backend.

If the test gives you an error, your backend URL configuration option likely has a typo.

If the version is not the latest version, you should update your backend instance.

If the name and description of the results don't match your own instance, make sure you have your backend URL set correctly.

## I updated from version 3 to version 4 but still see the old version

It is likely that you haven't installed the PWA version of movie-web. Please read the [upgrade guide](../3.client/5.upgrade.md) for more details on the matter.

## I'm getting SSL issues when using a hosted postgres database

You are most likely missing the `postgres.ssl` variable on your backend, enable it and the connection should work.

## Permission denied to set parameter "session_replication_role"

Set the `MIKRO_ORM_MIGRATIONS_DISABLE_FOREIGN_KEYS` option to `false` in either your `.env` or your Docker command.
